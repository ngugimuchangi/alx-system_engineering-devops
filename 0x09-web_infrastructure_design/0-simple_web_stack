# Network overview
A server is a computer hardware or software that provides functionality for other programs or devices called clients.
The network has one hardware server that houses three software servers: the web, application, and database servers.
Domain names make it easy for users to access websites without the need to remember their IP addresses.
Domain names are translated into IP addresses through a look up processes starting from the browser’s cache, system host files and eventually domain servers.
Domain servers contain various resource records to help in navigate the web. A records map domain names to their IP addresses e.g., www.foobar.com to 8.8.8.8.
The client computer communicates with the server by sending HTTP requests over TCP, once it obtains the server’s IP address.
The Web server provides the primary documentation such HTML layout and CSS presentation.
The application server provides the dynamic content, populating the HTML templates using data fetched from the database.
The database stores the user data.

# Issues
Reliance on a singly physical server introduces a single point of failure.
The whole system shuts down if the physical server fails. 
It is also difficult to update the codebase without interrupting servicing user requests. Scaling will be difficult as user requests increase and become a bottleneck.
