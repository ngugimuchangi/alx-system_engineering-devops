# Scaling out / Horizontal scaling
One of the major problems of the previous network was having a single load balancer, which was a single point of failure.
Adding a new HAproxy server solves this because it can take over if the other fails.
HAproxy servers also enable load balancing at several points in the network – particularly the transport and application layers.
In this case, our HAproxy servers are only implemented at the application layer.
